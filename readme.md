History

The word "copypasta" was first used on Usenet groups in 2006.[2]
Etymology

The term "copypasta" is derived from the computer term "copy/paste", and can be traced back to an anonymous 4chan imageboard from 2006.[1][3]
Notable examples
Navy Seal

The Navy Seal copypasta is a lengthy, comically written, aggressive attack paragraph against a "kiddo", written in the voice of the stereotypical "tough guy", listing absurd accomplishments such as having "over 300 confirmed kills" and being "trained in gorilla [sic] warfare". This copypasta is often reposted as a humorous overreaction to an insult and is thought to have originated in a post on a 4chan message board from 11 November 2010.[4]

This copypasta is infamously used on Brenton Tarrant's manifesto, The Great Replacement, which started the Christchurch mosque shootings.[5]
Bee Movie
Main article: Bee Movie § Internet popularity
